More often then not, when a project for a new business ventures starts, the group will define a \"Working Title\" to refer to it, and that title may or may not end up becoming the actual name later on. But would that be wise?\nWhat if we could have some more insight into naming conventions before choosing a definitive name for our business? Would that make any difference?\nAccording to this article[1], \"A study on behalf of the Society of Personal and Social Psychology, Inc. discovered stocks with easier to pronounce names outperformed those with names more difficult to pronounce\". That is something to take in consideration. So what other insights can we take from this?\nIn this article, we will explore a localized study of names used in business for the region of Toronto, Canada. We will look into the naming conventions of Food establishments, and drive our conclusions from there.\n\n*[1] Pozin, Ilya. \"Does the Name of Your Company Matter?\" Accessed on July 4 2019. https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237643*\n",
